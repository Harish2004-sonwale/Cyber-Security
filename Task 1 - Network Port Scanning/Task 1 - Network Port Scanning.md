# Cyber Security Task 1 - Network Port Scanning

## Task Overview
This task focuses on network scanning and port discovery using Nmap. The goal is to understand network exposure and potential security risks.

## Network Details
- **Local IP Address**: 192.168.1.10
- **Network Range**: 192.168.1.0/24
- **Date**: May 26, 2025

## Scan Methodology
1. **Nmap SYN Scan**
   - Type: TCP SYN Scan (-sS)
   - Target: 192.168.1.0/24
   - Output: scan_results.txt

2. **Wireshark Analysis**
   - Optional packet capture
   - TCP handshake analysis

## Security Analysis
### Common Ports and Services
- Port 80: HTTP
- Port 443: HTTPS
- Port 22: SSH
- Port 21: FTP

### Security Recommendations
1. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Restrict access to critical ports
   - Implement proper firewall rules

2. **Service Security**
   - Update all services
   - Implement strong authentication
   - Regular security audits

## Next Steps
1. Review scan results
2. Document findings
3. Create GitHub repository
4. Submit through internship form
