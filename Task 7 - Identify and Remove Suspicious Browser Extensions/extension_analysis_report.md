## 2. Suspicious Extensions Identified

*Instructions: Detail any extensions you identified as suspicious. Explain your reasoning (e.g., excessive permissions, poor reviews, unknown origin, unused).* 

### Extension 1: Super Enhancer Free (Google Chrome)
- **Reason for Suspicion:** Unrecognized extension, vague purpose ("Enhance browsing speed" is a common claim by PUPs), very poor user reviews often mentioning unwanted ads and redirects.
- **Permissions of Concern:** "Access data on all websites" and "modify data you copy/paste" are highly sensitive and unnecessary for a supposed speed enhancer. The latter could be used to steal or alter copied information.
- **Review Summary:** Reviews indicate it injects ads, changes search engine, and is difficult to remove.
- **Action Taken:** Removed immediately.

### Extension 2: PDF Viewer Lite (Google Chrome)
- **Reason for Suspicion:** Modern browsers have built-in PDF viewing capabilities, making a dedicated extension often redundant. While not overtly malicious, it's unused and requests broad permissions.
- **Permissions of Concern:** "Read browsing history" and "Access data on all websites" for a simple PDF viewer seems excessive. Could potentially track user activity.
- **Review Summary:** Mixed reviews; some find it useful, others report it's unnecessary or slows down the browser.
- **Action Taken:** Removed due to redundancy and over-privileged permissions for an unused tool.

### Extension 3: Easy Screen Capture (Mozilla Firefox)
- **Reason for Suspicion:** Unrecognized extension with a generic name. Firefox has built-in screenshot functionality.
- **Permissions of Concern:** "Access data on all websites" and "read browsing history" are not typically required for basic screen capture functionality. Could be used for tracking.
- **Review Summary:** Poor reviews, users complain about it not working as expected or being bundled with other unwanted software.
- **Action Taken:** Removed immediately.

## 3. Extensions Removed

*Instructions: List all extensions you removed and briefly state why for each.* 

1.  **Extension Name:** Super Enhancer Free (Google Chrome)
    *   **Reason for Removal:** Highly suspicious, excessive permissions, poor reviews indicating malicious behavior (adware, redirects).
2.  **Extension Name:** PDF Viewer Lite (Google Chrome)
    *   **Reason for Removal:** Unused, redundant functionality (browser has native PDF viewing), and requested excessive permissions for its purpose.
3.  **Extension Name:** Easy Screen Capture (Mozilla Firefox)
    *   **Reason for Removal:** Suspicious, unrecognized, redundant (browser has native screenshot tool), and requested excessive permissions.

## 4. Post-Removal Observations

*Instructions: Note any changes in browser performance or behavior after removing extensions (e.g., faster startup, fewer ads, resolved issues).* 

- **Google Chrome:** Browser startup seems slightly faster. No unexpected pop-up ads or search redirects encountered since removal of "Super Enhancer Free". Overall browsing feels cleaner.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** No significant performance change noted, but peace of mind from removing an unnecessary extension with broad permissions.

## 5. Research on Malicious Browser Extensions

*Instructions: Summarize your research on how malicious browser extensions can harm users. Include examples of threats and their impact.*

### Common Threats from Malicious Extensions:
- **Adware/Ad Injection:**
  - *Description:* Extensions that forcibly display unwanted advertisements, pop-ups, banners, or inject ads into web pages.
  - *Impact:* Annoying user experience, potential exposure to further malicious sites through ad clicks, slowed browser performance.
- **Data Theft (Credentials, Browsing History, PII):**
  - *Description:* Extensions designed to steal sensitive information such as login usernames and passwords, credit card details, personal identifiable information (PII), and browsing history.
  - *Impact:* Identity theft, financial loss, unauthorized access to online accounts, privacy breaches.
- **Session Hijacking:**
  - *Description:* Malicious extensions can steal active session cookies, allowing attackers to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their accounts without needing credentials.
  - *Impact:* Unauthorized account access, data breaches, financial fraud.
- **Search Engine/Homepage Hijacking:**
  - *Description:* Extensions that change the browser's default search engine, homepage, or new tab page to a specific site, often one that generates ad revenue for the attacker or promotes malicious content.
  - *Impact:* Forced exposure to unwanted content, potential phishing, difficulty reverting settings, collection of search queries.
- **Keylogging:**
  - *Description:* Extensions that record every keystroke made by the user, capturing sensitive data like passwords, messages, and financial information.
  - *Impact:* Complete compromise of typed information, leading to account takeovers and data theft.
- **Cryptojacking (Unauthorized Cryptocurrency Mining):**
  - *Description:* Extensions that secretly use the victim's computer resources (CPU/GPU) to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent.
  - *Impact:* Significant slowdown of computer performance, increased electricity consumption, wear and tear on hardware.
- **Malware Distribution:**
  - *Description:* Some extensions act as droppers or downloaders for other types of malware, such as ransomware, trojans, or spyware.
  - *Impact:* Full system compromise, data loss, financial extortion.

### How to Protect Yourself:
- **Install Sparingly:** Only install extensions from trusted developers and official browser web stores.
- **Check Permissions:** Carefully review the permissions an extension requests before installing. Be wary of extensions asking for more access than they seemingly need for their stated function.
- **Read Reviews:** Look at user reviews and ratings. Pay attention to negative reviews detailing suspicious behavior.
- **Keep Updated:** Keep your browser and extensions updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Regularly Audit:** Periodically review your installed extensions and remove any you no longer use, don't recognize, or deem suspicious.
- **Use Security Software:** A good antivirus/anti-malware solution can help detect and block malicious extensions or their payloads.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

*Instructions: Briefly summarize your findings and any personal recommendations for maintaining browser security regarding extensions.*

- This exercise highlighted the importance of regularly auditing browser extensions. It's easy for unused or even malicious extensions to accumulate over time.
- Key takeaways include always scrutinizing permissions, checking reviews from multiple sources, and preferring extensions from well-known, reputable developers.
- If an extension's functionality seems too good to be true or if it requests overly broad permissions for a simple task, it's best to avoid it or seek alternatives.
- Removing unnecessary extensions not only improves security but can also enhance browser performance.
- It's recommended to perform such an audit at least quarterly or whenever suspicious browser behavior is noticed.
