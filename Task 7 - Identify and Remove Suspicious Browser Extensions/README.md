# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.

## Tools
- Any web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge)

## Deliverables
- A list of suspicious browser extensions found and removed (if any).
- Documentation of the steps taken during the review and removal process.
- Research notes on how malicious browser extensions can harm users.

## Hints/Mini Guide

1.  **Open Extension Manager:** Access your browserâ€™s extension or add-ons manager.
    *   **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions`
    *   **Firefox:** `about:addons`
    *   **Edge:** `edge://extensions`
2.  **Review Installed Extensions:** Carefully examine all installed extensions.
    *   Do you recognize each extension?
    *   When was it installed?
    *   Do you still use it?
3.  **Check Permissions and Reviews:** For each extension, investigate:
    *   **Permissions:** What data or browser functions can it access? Are these permissions excessive for its stated purpose?
    *   **Reviews & Ratings:** What do other users say about it? Look for reviews on the browser's web store or other reputable sources.
    *   **Source:** Is it from a trusted developer or a reputable source?
4.  **Identify Suspicious/Unused Extensions:** Look for red flags:
    *   Extensions you don't remember installing.
    *   Extensions with overly broad permissions (e.g., access to all website data).
    *   Poor reviews or reports of malicious behavior.
    *   Extensions you no longer need or use.
5.  **Remove Extensions:** Remove any extensions identified as suspicious, unnecessary, or unused.
6.  **Restart and Observe:** Restart your browser after removing extensions. Check for any improvements in performance or changes in browser behavior.
7.  **Research Malicious Extensions:** Investigate and note down the common ways malicious extensions can compromise user security and privacy. Examples include:
    *   Injecting ads
    *   Stealing browsing history
    *   Redirecting searches
    *   Logging keystrokes (keyloggers)
    *   Stealing login credentials
    *   Installing other malware
8.  **Document Findings:** Record the steps you took, the extensions you reviewed, any extensions you removed (and why), and your research findings.

## Outcome
- Increased awareness of the security risks associated with browser extensions.
- Practical experience in managing browser extensions to enhance security and privacy.
