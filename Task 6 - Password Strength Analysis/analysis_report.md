- **Length:** 20 characters
- **Character Types:** All (Upper, Lower, Digits, Symbols)
- **Strength Metrics:**
  - Time to crack: 1.7 centuries
  - Entropy: 8.5 bits/character
  - Strengths:
    - Excellent length
    - Maximum character variety
    - No dictionary words
    - No predictable patterns
    - High entropy

## Security Considerations

### Attack Vectors
1. **Brute Force Attacks**
   - Time required increases exponentially with password length
   - Additional character types significantly increase difficulty

2. **Dictionary Attacks**
   - None of the generated passwords contain dictionary words
   - Random combinations make dictionary attacks ineffective

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - All passwords use random combinations
   - No predictable patterns or sequences

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Password Length**
   - Minimum 12 characters recommended
   - Longer is always better
   - 16+ characters provides excellent security

2. **Character Variety**
   - Use all four character types
   - Avoid common patterns
   - Include special characters

3. **Additional Security**
   - Use different passwords for different accounts
   - Change passwords periodically
   - Consider using a password manager

## Recommendations

1. **For Personal Use**
   - Use passwords 16+ characters long
   - Include all character types
   - Avoid patterns and dictionary words

2. **For Enterprise Use**
   - Implement password policies
   - Use password managers
   - Regular security audits

3. **General Security**
   - Enable 2FA where possible
   - Regular security updates
   - Security awareness training
